COVID-19 Global Data Tracker

This project analyzes and visualizes global COVID-19 trends using real-world data. It focuses on selected countries ‚Äî **Kenya**, **United States**, and **India** ‚Äî to explore the evolution of cases, deaths, and vaccinations over time.

Project Objectives

-Import and clean COVID-19 data from [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus).
- Analyze time trends in total cases, deaths, and new daily infections.
- Compare key metrics across Kenya, USA, and India.
- Visualize trends using line charts and bar plots.
- Communicate key insights with clear narrative explanations.

Tools and Technologies

- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

Dataset
